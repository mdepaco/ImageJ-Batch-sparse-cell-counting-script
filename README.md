# ImageJ Batch sparse cell counting script

This is a simple script for ImageJ for quantifying separate cells in batch mode. Useful for sparse cells in tissue sections.

## Functions:

- Open images one by one (in a user specified folder)
- User draws ROI
- Applies pre-set threshold (in this case 600, 65535)
- Run particle analysis (in this case 60-1400 pixel size)
- Closes images (NOT saving them)
- Lets user choose where to save results/summary table

Hope it can be useful for someone else with similar needs :)
